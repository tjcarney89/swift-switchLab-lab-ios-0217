//: First let's try some of last lab's questions but using a 'switch' instead of 'if' or 'if/else'. Can you figure out the types of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` without option clicking the constants?

// Given....
let x = 5.0
let y = 12
let a = 321
let b = 32




/*: Question 1
### **(1)** Print "true" if a modulo b is equal to zero.
*/








/*: Question 2
### **(2)** Print 'true' if y divided by x is greater than three, otherwise print 'false'.
*/







/*: Question 3
### **(3)** Print 'true' if y is greater than x and a divided by b is greater than 9. If there's any need to convert to either an `Int` or a `Double` to satisfy the requirements of a binary operator (you can choose whichever one you want to convert to to satisfy the requirements).
*/








/*: Question 4
### **(4)** Write a function named `isGreater` that takes two `Int` arguments and returns a `String`. This function should look to see if `a` is greater than `b`. If it is, it returns back the `String` 'yep', else it returns back the `String` 'nope`.
*/









/*: Question 5
### **(5)** Write a function named `isForce` that takes a `String` argument which represents a persons name and returns a `Bool`. If the persons name is equal to the name of someone with the force, return `true`, else return `false`. People with the force are Luke, Leia, Anakin, Obi Wan, Yoda & Vader.
 ```swift
 isForce(with:"Luke") // true
 isForce(with:"Mary") // false
 ```
*/








/*: Question 6
### **(6)** Write a function "isInRange" that takes an Int  argument and prints "small" if it's in the range of 0 and 3, "medium" if it's in the range of 4 and 6, "big" if it's in the range of 7 and 10, and otherwise prints "not sure".
 ```swift
 isInRange(0) // prints "small"
 isInRange(99) // prints "not sure"
 isInRange(5) // prints "big"
 ```
